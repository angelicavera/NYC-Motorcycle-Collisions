# NYC-Open-Data-Motorcycle-Collision
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset on motorcycle accidents in New York City. The motivation behind this analysis stems from my personal interest as a motorcycle owner. Riding a motorcycle carries inherent risks, and understanding the patterns and factors associated with motorcycle accidents can help raise awareness and promote safer riding practices.

Dataset:
The data was obtained from NYC Open Data, a free, accessible, and publicly available resource. It includes details such as accident locations, dates, fatalities, injuries, and other relevant factors.

Tools and Technologies:
Python was used as the primary programming language for data analysis. Libraries such as pandas, plotly express, datetime, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib were utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Findings:

Risk and Fatality Rate:

Riding a motorcycle carries a high level of risk, with motorcycle fatalities accounting for nearly 12% of all vehicle fatalities in NYC, despite motorcycles comprising only 2% of registered vehicles.
Accidents are prevalent across various locations, emphasizing the need for caution, particularly on highways, expressways, and busy avenues where more fatalities occur.
Seasonal and Time-of-Day Patterns:

The majority of accidents occur during the warmer months, weekends, and rush hours. To avoid such risk, opt for rides in cooler months, weekdays, and morning hours can help reduce the risk.
Injury Risk:

While not all motorcycle accidents result in fatalities, the risk of sustaining injuries is higher compared to no injury. Being a defensive driver and wearing appropriate protective gear are crucial for personal safety.
Conclusion:
This analysis, conducted using Python, highlights the importance of understanding the risks associated with motorcycle riding and taking necessary precautions. By promoting defensive driving, wearing protective gear, and being mindful of high-risk areas and times, motorcycle enthusiasts can enhance their safety on the road.

Note:
The findings presented here are based on the analysis of the available dataset, and it is essential to exercise caution and refer to official safety guidelines and regulations while riding a motorcycle. The information provided in this project is for educational and informational purposes only.
